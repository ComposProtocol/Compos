# OCF & CVM

To facilitate the composition of logic inscriptions, Compos Protocol has introduced a novel category of logic inscriptions named OCF (OnChain Function), which plays an integral role in augmenting asset inscriptions like BRC-20, Runes, and Ordinals NFT. It operates within the CVM, a virtual machine implemented using WASM.

OCF can enhance all existing BRC-20 and Runes assets by infusing them with on-chain logic, enabling smart contracts on Bitcoin. To some extent, OCF is decentralized and on-chain and cannot be arbitrarily modified by project developers.

Potential OCF applications include:

1. Bitcoin Native DeFi: Swap, Lending, etc.
2. Bitcoin Native Games
3. Bitcoin Native Social Apps
4. ERC404-like protocols natively on Bitcoin
5. â€¦
